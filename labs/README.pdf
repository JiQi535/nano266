\chapter{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

Welcome to the lab sessions for NANO266. Before you begin, you should read this
carefully and follow all instructions to make sure that your computer \slash 
computing resource is set up properly. Your instructors are on hand to help you
if you run into any problems.

\chapter{Cloning the repo}
\label{cloningtherepo}

You should first clone this repo by doing:

\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{2.5em}
\begin{verbatim}

git clone https://github.com/materialsvirtuallab/nano266.git

\end{verbatim}
\end{adjustwidth}

This assumes you already have git installed, which comes by default in Mac
and can easily be installed in Unix-based OSes. To update your repo to the
latest version at any time, you can do:

\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{2.5em}
\begin{verbatim}

git pull

\end{verbatim}
\end{adjustwidth}

from within the repo.

\chapter{First Principles Modelling Codes}
\label{firstprinciplesmodellingcodes}

In the labs, we will be using two open-source first principles modeling codes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item NWchem (http:\slash \slash www.nwchem-sw.org) is a computational chemistry code that
 aims to be scalable both in their ability to treat large scientific
 computational chemistry problems efficiently.

\item QuantumEspresso (http:\slash \slash www.quantum-espresso.org\slash ) is an integrated suite of
 computer codes for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling
 at the nanoscale. It is based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and
 pseudopotentials.

\end{enumerate}

Before you start any of the labs, make sure that you have the software
installed and in your path. You have three options:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If you have your own Mac or Ubuntu 64-bit, you can use the
 executables already included in this repo. Run the following command to add
 the bin directory to your path as follows (assuming you are on bash):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
export PATH=$PATH:<path/to/repo>/bin/Mac or Ubuntu
# The following is to set the NWChem basis sets used in lab1. Be careful
# that the ending slash is needed!
export NWCHEM_BASIS_LIBRARY = <path/to/repo>/resources/nwchem_basis/
\end{lstlisting}

\item You can download VirtualBox (https:\slash \slash www.virtualbox.org\slash ), and a
 pre-configured Ubuntu virtual machine at this \href{https://s3.amazonaws.com/mavrl-web/nano266.ova}{link}\footnote{\href{https://s3.amazonaws.com/mavrl-web/nano266.ova}{https:/\slash s3.amazonaws.com\slash mavrl-web\slash nano266.ova}}.
 Note that it is a hefty 3 Gb download, so you will want to download this on
 a fast connection. After launching VirtualBox, do File-$>$Import Appliance and
 then select the downloaded \texttt{nano266.ova} file. You can then start the
 virtual machine. You should be able to login to the virtual machine without
 a password. If one is ever needed, it is simply ``nano266fun''. Start a
 terminal by clicking on the icon on the left. By typing \texttt{ls}, you should see
 that a nano266 directory is already cloned for you. Simply \texttt{cd nano266} and
 you are ready to begin to do the labs.

\item You can download the source code for QuantumEspresso or NWChem and install it
 yourself. \emph{Attempt this only if you have a fairly good familiarity with
 compiling things on Unix-based OSes, or are willing to spend the time to
 figure it out!} If you foresee you will be working on such calculations
 extensively in future, it is generally useful for you to learn how to do
 this. Start with the QuantumEspresso code as it is more straightforward to
 compile.

\end{enumerate}

In general, it is not recommended that you run on a native Windows OS for these
labs. Most first principles codes are designed to run primarily on
supercomputing clusters that have Unix-based OSes. If you have a Windows
machine, you should try option 2 above.

\chapter{Programming code}
\label{programmingcode}

A lot of the labs use Python as a scripting language for automating
calculations and analysis. You should ensure that you have Python 2.7.x
installed with numpy. If you have a Mac, this should be already the case. If you use the virtual machine, it is also already set up.

If you don't know Python, get a quick primer from the official Python documentation at https:\slash \slash docs.python.org\slash 2.7\slash . You don't really need to know much more than that for the purposes of the labs. Learning how to use a scripting language like Python can save you loads of time in automating calculations.
