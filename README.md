# Introduction

This is the public repository for UCSD's NANO266 - Quantum Mechanical Modeling of Materials and Nanostructures taught by Prof Shyue Ping Ong. The purpose of this repo is to serve as a persistent and evolving collection of supplementary course materials that illustrate various symmetry and crystallography concepts and computations. Most of the code are written in python and presented in ipython notebooks. Some static material may be created in LaTeX.

While this repo is completely open and anyone is welcome to use the materials
contain therein, I would ask that you acknowledge any usage.

# Viewing the Notebooks

You can explore the notebooks using the excellent online ipython notebook viewer. 
To begin, go to this [link](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/materialsvirtuallab/nano266/tree/master/) which points to the root directory.
